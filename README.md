# Lending-Club-Case-Study

The organisation **Lending Club** is as a peer-to-peer company that acts as a marketplace for matching possible investors with available loan applicants. 
Once an Applicant applies for a loan, the company performs a risk assessment based on the applicant's profile.
Approving loans on risky applicants can lead to financial losses, while rejecting loan approvals for safe applicants lead to loss of business.

Hence, this Case Study is aimed at determining the driving factors of loan defaulting.
